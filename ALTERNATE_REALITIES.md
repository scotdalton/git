# Alternate Realities

## Branches

Branches allow us to create alternate realities. Usually we base them off of our
main reality, which we often call `master`.

### Rebase vs Merging
Once an alternate reality gets merged into the main reality, all other alternate
realities are based on an outdated understanding of the main reality.

Rebasing and merging are two ways to make sure we update the alternate realities
understanding of the main reality.

### Mohawks and Tattoos

```sh
~> git co scot
~> git co -b tattoos
~> git co -b mohawk
~> git co -b mullet
```
