## Tools

### Git
- Git is a just tool
- it takes snapshots of your code (commits)
- commit often (5-10 mins, depending on your flow)
- push less often
- commit messages tell the story of your code
  - what and why vs. how
- allows you to figure out what the hell you were thinking when you wrote your code
